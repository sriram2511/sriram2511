# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm SRIRAM K, a Data Science enthusiast.

ðŸŒ± I recently graduated with an M.Sc. in Data Science from Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai.

ðŸ”­ I also completed an internship as a Data Science and Analytics Intern at Skillveri Ltd.


ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience in implementing machine learning in real-world projects or my journey in data science. I love to teach and share my knowledge with others. I am always up for a fruitful conversation regarding my subjects.

ðŸ“« You can reach out to me at [sriramchitra25@gmail.com](mailto:sriramchitra25@gmail.com) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sriram01/).


âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy solving Rubik's Cubes in my free time and capturing moments through photography.
